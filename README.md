- This piano uses Web Audio API to play an audio file, then change the pitch based on the key
- For the piano, I used this example from NexusUI: https://nexus-js.github.io/ui/api/#Piano
- For changing the pitch, I modified this example to be based on the number from the key response: https://www.gregjopa.com/2023/03/piano-sounds-with-web-audio-api
